  // REVIEW: We no longer need our prototype toHtml() method. This functionality has been relocated to the view.
  //         As a result, Article.prototype.toHtml has been deleted.

  // REVIEW: With ES6 arrow functions, if the function only has one parameter, you don't need parentheses.
  //         This is similar to saying Article.loadAll = function(rows).

    //the loadAll function lives within Article.js. It has a single argument, rows. Based on the sort method called we can determine that rows is an array. And based on the property calls within sort we can determine that the contents of rows our objects with a property of published on, with values that are dates. the sort method sorts them in descending order of their publishing date. The sorted row is then mapped to a new array with each object being passed as a parameter for an Article constructor. The Artile property all, which is an empty array, is then assigned to this new mapped array of Article objects.
  Article.loadAll = rows => {
    rows.sort((a,b) => (new Date(b.publishedOn)) - (new Date(a.publishedOn)));
    Article.all = rows.map(ele => new Article(ele));
